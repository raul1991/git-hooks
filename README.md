# git-hooks
A list of hooks that I have or will make in future for my daily development workflow

## Requirements

##### Windows
	
	 	1. python
	 	2. git bash
		
##### Linux (not tested yet)
	 	1. python

## Pre-Commit hook
This hook is fired up by GIT everytime you `commit`. Whenever you code contains white-spaces this hook would prevent it from going into the upstream branch and fix it for you. Your work after that would be just to add the "affected files" again into git.
### How to install
Run this command -> `./init.sh`
